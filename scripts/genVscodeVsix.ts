/**
 * Codegen: build + package the first-party VS Code extension (editors/vscode/)
 * into a `.vsix`, then embed that artifact — base64-encoded — into a TypeScript
 * constants module so phantombot's compiled single-ELF binary can stamp it onto
 * disk at runtime and run `code --install-extension <vsix>` (see
 * src/connectors/acp/installVscode.ts).
 *
 * Why an embedded base64 constants module (same shape as
 * scripts/genPiExtensionAssets.ts)?
 *   - `bun build --compile` produces a SINGLE ELF with no repo alongside it, so
 *     the shipped binary cannot fs-read `editors/vscode/*.vsix` at runtime.
 *   - `import ... with { type: "..." }` is NOT tsc-safe in this toolchain
 *     (`tsc --noEmit` rejects it). A plain generated `.ts` with the bytes as a
 *     JSON-encoded base64 string literal sidesteps that and stays
 *     `bun build --compile`-self-contained.
 *   - The `.vsix` is a binary zip; zip bytes are NOT reproducible across builds
 *     (timestamps/metadata vary), so we deliberately do NOT assert byte-exact
 *     drift. Instead the checked-in module records the extension VERSION, and
 *     tests/lib-vscodeExtensionAsset.test.ts asserts (a) the embedded version
 *     matches editors/vscode/package.json and (b) the bytes decode to a valid
 *     zip carrying the extension manifest + bundled extension.js.
 *
 *     Note what that does NOT catch, because it shipped a broken release: it
 *     only detects a version bump WITHOUT a regen. The failure that actually
 *     bit us is the mirror image — editing editors/vscode/ and regenerating
 *     NEITHER the version NOR this asset, which leaves both sides mutually
 *     consistent and stale, so every assertion here passes. See
 *     PHANTOMBOT_EXT_VERSION below for how the release closes that hole.
 *
 * Run: `bun run gen:vscode-vsix`. Requires network the first time (npx fetches
 * @vscode/vsce). Regenerate whenever editors/vscode/ changes.
 *
 * ## PHANTOMBOT_EXT_VERSION — why the release overrides the version
 *
 * The extension version is what `installVscode` compares against to decide
 * whether to install (`installed >= bundled` ⇒ skip as "current"). Left to a
 * hand-maintained `editors/vscode/package.json` bump, that produced a silent,
 * user-visible failure: PR #296 changed the extension's source, nobody bumped
 * the version and nobody re-ran this script, so the release shipped a STALE
 * embedded .vsix that every client then skipped as "current". The fix never
 * reached a single user, and `phantombot update` reported success.
 *
 * So the release pipeline sets `PHANTOMBOT_EXT_VERSION` to the phantombot
 * release version (`1.1.<run_number>`) and runs this script on every build.
 * That makes both failure modes structurally impossible:
 *
 *   - The .vsix is always packaged from the CURRENT source tree, so it can
 *     never lag the code that was merged.
 *   - The version always increases (run_number is monotonic), so clients
 *     always see "bundled newer than installed" and actually install.
 *
 * Locally the env var is unset and we fall back to the checked-in
 * package.json version — dev behaviour is unchanged.
