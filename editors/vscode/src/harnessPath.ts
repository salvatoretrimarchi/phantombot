/**
 * PATH parity for the `phantombot acp` subprocess: prepend the well-known
 * harness install directories the DAEMON already searches via
 * `src/lib/harnessAvailability.ts:harnessSearchPath()`, so a harness that's
 * pinned by absolute path in `state.json` (e.g. `claude.EXE` at
 * `~/.local/bin/claude.EXE`) still has what ITS OWN launch needs on the PATH
 * the extension hands the child process.
 *
 * THE GAP THIS CLOSES: `resolveHarnessBinary()` on the daemon side finds a
 * harness binary either on PATH or by walking `harnessSearchPath()` and
 * pins the resolved ABSOLUTE path into `state.json`. Absolute-path resolution
 * means the extension's spawn of `phantombot acp` finds claude/pi/etc fine
 * regardless of PATH. But once phantombot decides to run that harness, IT
 * spawns claude/pi/gemini/codex as ITS OWN child \u2014 and those binaries are
 * frequently Node scripts (`#!/usr/bin/env node`) or wrapper shims that shell
 * out to other tools on PATH (see the shebang-needs-interpreter-on-path
 * lesson, phantombot#240 / withCommandDirOnPath). The daemon (systemd/
 * scheduled task) has a narrow PATH but phantombot's OWN spawn helpers already
 * compensate for that per-harness. VS Code hands the ACP child a PATH that is
 * *editor-inherited*, which on Windows in particular routinely excludes
 * `~/.local/bin` (where nvm/fnm/volta-installed CLIs and their `node`
 * interpreter live side by side) \u2014 collapsing an otherwise-healthy
 * claude-then-pi chain down to pi-only the moment claude's OWN spawn fails
 * silently inside phantombot's harness code.
 *
 * This module mirrors (does not replace) `harnessSearchPath()` server-side \u2014
 * pure, no fs access beyond what's handed in, so it's unit-testable without
 * touching a real home directory. It only ADDS directories; it never removes
 * or reorders what's already on PATH.
