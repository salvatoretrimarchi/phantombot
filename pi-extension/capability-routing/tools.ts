/**
 * Pure registration-decision logic for the capability-routing extension.
 *
 * Kept separate from index.ts (the @earendil-works/* glue) so it can be
 * unit-tested from phantombot's `bun test` without the Pi SDK on the import
 * path — the tests import THIS file and assert which tools should register
 * given a routing config object.
 *
 * The config comes from a managed sibling data file `routing.json` that
 * phantombot stamps into the extension directory (see index.ts). Its shape:
 *
 *   {
 *     "primaryModel":  "...",   // informational; the extension does NOT switch
 *                               //   the primary itself — phantombot's pi harness
 *                               //   passes --model. Surfaced for logging only.
 *     "imageModel":    "...",   // present ⇒ register look_at_image (vision delegate)
 *     "codingModel":   "..."    // present ⇒ register coder         (coding delegate)
 *   }
 *
 * Every key is optional. The KEY rule: when `imageModel` is absent/empty,
 * `look_at_image` is NOT registered. phantombot omits it precisely when the
 * primary model is multimodal (it can see images itself), so a multimodal
 * primary gets no redundant vision tool. Env vars are NOT read by the
 * extension anymore — routing.json is the sole input.
