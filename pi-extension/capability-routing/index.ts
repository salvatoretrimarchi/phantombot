/**
 * Capability-routing Pi extension (phantombot).
 *
 * Lets a strong-but-narrow PRIMARY Pi model delegate specialist subtasks
 * within a single turn:
 *
 *   look_at_image(path, question) — spawns the IMAGE model to answer a
 *       specific question about an image. Registered ONLY when the primary is
 *       NOT multimodal (the wizard records an `imageModel` in routing.json only
 *       then; for a multimodal primary the key is absent and this tool never
 *       appears — the primary looks at the image itself).
 *
 *   coder(task) — spawns the CODING model as a fresh `pi` process with
 *       edit,bash,write for a PR/MR-scoped job or review. Coarse-grained:
 *       process startup is expensive, so each call should be a big chunk, not
 *       a chatty round-trip. Usage/cost is surfaced back to the parent.
 *
 * This is capability routing WITHIN a turn — orthogonal to phantombot's
 * primary→fallback harness chain (failover), which this extension does not
 * touch.
 *
 * Reads its config from a managed sibling data file `routing.json` in this
 * extension's own directory (see ./tools.ts for the shape). The extension
 * needs zero knowledge of phantombot's config files or env vars.
 *
 * MANAGED SOURCE: this directory is OWNED by phantombot — it is stamped into
 * ~/.pi/agent/extensions/capability-routing/ on every phantombot startup (and
 * repaired by `phantombot doctor`), overwriting any local edits. To change the
 * extension, edit pi-extension/capability-routing/ in the phantombot repo and
 * regenerate the embedded assets (`bun run gen:pi-extension`). A manual symlink
 * (see ./README.md) is only for extension development.
