/**
 * Capability-routing Pi extension (phantombot).
 *
 * Lets a strong-but-narrow PRIMARY Pi model delegate specialist subtasks
 * within a single turn:
 *
 *   look_at_image(path, question) — spawns the IMAGE model to answer a
 *       specific question about an image. Registered ONLY when the primary is
 *       NOT multimodal (the wizard records an `imageModel` in routing.json only
 *       then; for a multimodal primary the key is absent and this tool never
 *       appears — the primary looks at the image itself).
 *
 *   coder(task) — spawns the CODING model as a fresh `pi` process with
 *       edit,bash,write for a PR/MR-scoped job or review. Coarse-grained:
 *       process startup is expensive, so each call should be a big chunk, not
 *       a chatty round-trip. Usage/cost is surfaced back to the parent.
 *
 * This is capability routing WITHIN a turn — orthogonal to phantombot's
 * primary→fallback harness chain (failover), which this extension does not
 * touch.
 *
 * Reads its config from a managed sibling data file `routing.json` in this
 * extension's own directory (see ./tools.ts for the shape). The extension
 * needs zero knowledge of phantombot's config files or env vars.
 *
 * MANAGED SOURCE: this directory is OWNED by phantombot — it is stamped into
 * ~/.pi/agent/extensions/capability-routing/ on every phantombot startup (and
 * repaired by `phantombot doctor`), overwriting any local edits. To change the
 * extension, edit pi-extension/capability-routing/ in the phantombot repo and
 * regenerate the embedded assets (`bun run gen:pi-extension`). A manual symlink
 * (see ./README.md) is only for extension development.

/**
 * Build an ACCUMULATING progress sink that forwards the coder child's per-turn
 * events to the user via `phantombot notify`. Returns undefined when streaming
 * is off globally, so the delegate runs in its original silent mode.
 *
 * Channel-agnostic by construction: the sink only shells out to `phantombot
 * notify`, which fans the message out to the first owner of EVERY configured
 * channel for the persona (Telegram + phantomchat today, any future channel as
 * `notify` grows). This extension deliberately knows nothing about channels —
 * it never touches Telegram (or any other channel) code directly, so progress
 * automatically reaches whatever channels the persona has, not just Telegram.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *  - Per-conversation override: the persistent `/viewcoder` choice for this
 *    conversation wins over the global default, re-read at EMIT time so a mid-
 *    job toggle takes effect. `off` suppresses streaming; `on` forces it even
 *    when the global default is off.
 *  - Hybrid batching (Option C): lines accumulate into a buffer and flush as
 *    ONE digest notify when EITHER the coder has been idle ~5s OR the buffer
 *    reaches ~10 lines — whichever comes first. The `finally`-driven
 *    onProgressEnd drains the tail so nothing is lost at the end.
 *  - Fire-and-forget: each flush is a detached `phantombot notify`; we never
 *    await it and swallow every error. Progress must never slow down or break
 *    the actual coding job.
 *  - Skips terminal turns: that text is the final answer, which the parent
 *    model already receives as the tool result — no need to double-report it.
 *
 * `globalDefault` is the routing.json `codingProgress` flag. Streaming for THIS
 * job is on when: override === "on", OR (override === undefined AND
 * globalDefault). override === "off" always wins (silent).
