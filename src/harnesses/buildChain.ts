/**
 * Build the harness chain from config. Single source of truth — was
 * previously duplicated in src/cli/run.ts and src/cli/tick.ts and is
 * now imported from both. The "third place" risk surfaces every time
 * a new harness lands; this helper retires it.
 *
 * Unknown harness ids are logged to err and skipped — same lenient
 * shape the duplicated copies had. Returning [] from here is treated
 * by the callers as "no harnesses configured" → exit 2 with a hint.
