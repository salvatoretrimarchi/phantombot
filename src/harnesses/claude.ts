/**
 * Claude Code harness. Reference implementation for phantombot harnesses.
 *
 * Spawns `claude --print` and streams its stream-json stdout back as
 * HarnessChunks. Tool execution (Bash / Read / Write / WebFetch / etc.)
 * happens inside the claude subprocess — phantombot only sees the text
 * the model emits.
 *
 * Patches inherited from earlier work on a claude-max-api-proxy fork
 * (~/clawd/claude-proxy/ on the OpenClaw VPS):
 *
 *   1. PROMPT VIA STDIN, NOT ARGV.
 *      Linux ARG_MAX (~2 MB) is a real ceiling for large persona/memory
 *      contexts. argv-based prompts hit `spawn E2BIG`. claude --print
 *      reads stdin natively when no prompt arg is given.
 *
 *   2. SYSTEM PROMPT VIA --system-prompt.
 *      If you embed the persona inside the user-prompt body (e.g. wrapped
 *      in <system> tags), claude treats it as user-input data and often
 *      shortcuts to terse / sentinel responses. --system-prompt installs
 *      the persona as Claude Code's actual system prompt; it also drops
 *      Claude Code's per-machine dynamic sections (cwd, env, git status)
 *      which is what we want for a chat agent.
 *
 *   3. --permission-mode bypassPermissions.
 *      In --print mode there is no human to approve tool use. Without
 *      this, tool calls silently fail or hang. Acceptable trade-off for a
 *      single-operator chat agent on a trusted host. Re-evaluate if you
 *      ever multi-tenant.
 *
 *   4. --fallback-model sonnet.
 *      When opus rate-limits, claude transparently retries on sonnet
 *      within the SAME subprocess and SAME tool loop. Cleanest possible
 *      Anthropic-internal fallback. Configurable via env.
 *
 *   5. NO --bare.
 *      --bare strips Claude Code defaults (auto-memory, hook discovery,
 *      CLAUDE.md auto-load) but requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and refuses
 *      OAuth/keychain credentials. Incompatible with the Claude Max
 *      subscription path. Don't add it back unless that changes upstream.
 *
 * Auth model under phantombot:
 *   The entire ANTHROPIC_* / CLAUDE_CODE_* auth+routing namespace is
 *   filtered out of the subprocess env (see filterAuthEnv) so claude
 *   resolves credentials only from ~/.claude/.credentials.json (the OAuth
 *   path that backs Claude Max). Phantombot does not hold or pass any
 *   API keys, auth tokens, or base-URL overrides.

/**
 * Settings injected into every `claude --print` invocation via `--settings`.
 *
 * The Claude Code harness ships a small set of "deferred" tools the model can
 * call from inside a session — including `CronCreate` / `CronDelete` /
 * `CronList`, an in-memory single-session scheduler. They're session-bound:
 * dies with the subprocess, invisible to `phantombot task list`, no audit
 * trail, no persistence across phantombot restarts.
 *
 * That makes them a foot-gun for our use case. A persona ("matt") asked for a
 * recurring check called CronCreate — the schedule lived ~5 seconds (until
 * the --print subprocess exited) and the user had no way to verify. The
 * positive fix is the SCHEDULING_TOOLS_SECTION in persona/builder.ts which
 * teaches the model to use `phantombot task` instead. THIS deny-list is the
 * backstop: even if the model reaches for CronCreate in a moment of weakness,
 * the harness refuses.
 *
 * We deliberately deny only the three scheduler tools. Bash, Read, Edit,
 * WebFetch, and the rest of the Claude Code surface remain available — we're
 * not crippling the harness, just removing the one footgun that has zero
 * legitimate use given `phantombot task` exists.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * FRAME THIS CORRECTLY: the FEATURE is `phantombot task`, not the deny-list.
 *
 * Denying Cron* is not phantombot lacking a scheduler — it is phantombot
 * REPLACING a deliberately-inferior one with a better one. `phantombot task`
 * is a real, persistent scheduler: SQLite-backed, survives restarts and
 * crashes, visible in `phantombot task list`, every fire logged to
 * `task_runs`, cancelable by id, with two-layer delivery guarantees. The
 * harness's Cron* tools are the opposite on every axis — session-bound,
 * vanish when the --print subprocess exits seconds later, invisible to the
 * user, no fire log, no persistence. They LOOK like they work and silently
 * don't.
 *
 * So this is a phantombot capability that goes above and beyond the harness
 * default, not a hole in it. Do NOT "restore functionality" by removing this
 * deny-list — that re-opens the exact silent-failure footgun (`phantombot
 * task` already covers every legitimate use). Intentional, load-bearing.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Layering: --settings is additive on top of ~/.claude/settings.json. The
 * operator's own user settings are NOT modified by phantombot, so running
 * `claude` directly outside phantombot (emergency repairs, dev work) is
 * unaffected by this injection.
 *
 * Exported for testing and so the doc-string above is greppable.

 * and a `message` payload. The assistant content is an array of blocks
 * with their own `type`: `text`, `thinking`, `tool_use`, `tool_result`.
 * Claude reports tool results in user-typed messages; we surface those as
 * heartbeats too so the timeout coordinator can clear the tool-running latch
 * without flushing user-visible narration.
 *
 * Channel layers want three distinct signals from us:
 *   - `text` blocks → user-visible reply (concatenate, surface verbatim).
 *   - `tool_use` blocks → `progress` so the channel layer can flush pending
 *     narration before the model runs its tool.
 *   - `thinking` / `tool_result` → `heartbeat` (refreshes typing indicator,
 *     but does NOT flush narration — mirrors pi.ts behavior).
 *
 * If a single assistant message contains BOTH text and non-text blocks,
 * text wins (it carries strictly more signal). If it has both tool_use
 * and thinking, progress wins (tool_use is the signal that matters).
 * Thinking-only messages get a heartbeat — they don't fragment the
 * narration bubble.
 *
 * Actual content stays inside the subprocess; we never leak
 * chain-of-thought.
