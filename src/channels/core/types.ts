/**
 * ============================================================================
 *  CHANNEL ABSTRACTION SEAM
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This module defines the channel-agnostic interfaces the conversational
 * core (see `core/engine.ts`) talks to. It is the seam where NEW channels
 * (Matrix, and maybe Slack / Google Chat later) slot in WITHOUT any further
 * refactor of the engine.
 *
 * The contract, in one sentence:
 *
 *   The core only ever sees PLAINTEXT, channel-agnostic messages, and only
 *   ever speaks to a channel through the `Channel` adapter.
 *
 * --- The encryption seam (READ THIS BEFORE ADDING MATRIX) ---------------------
 *
 * A `Channel` exposes `encrypt(outbound)` / `decrypt(inbound)` hooks. These
 * are the ONLY place transport-level encryption ever happens:
 *
 *   - On ingest, the adapter calls `decrypt` so the engine receives plaintext.
 *   - On egress, the adapter calls `encrypt` so the wire carries ciphertext.
 *
 * Telegram bots have NO end-to-end encryption, so Telegram's `encrypt` /
 * `decrypt` are IDENTITY PASS-THROUGHS (see `telegram/channel.ts`). An
 * encrypted channel — e.g. Matrix with Megolm — would implement these so that
 * decrypt-on-ingest / encrypt-on-egress happens HERE, leaving the core
 * completely unaware that the conversation is encrypted on the wire.
 *
 * Do NOT add any crypto code to this repo today. This file defines the SHAPE
 * of the seam only; no algorithm, no key handling, no Matrix SDK.
 *
 * --- The inbound-loop seam ----------------------------------------------------
 *
 * `Channel.listen(signal)` is the channel-agnostic inbound-message loop shape:
 * an `AsyncIterable<ChannelMessage>` a future engine can `for await` over,
 * independent of whether the underlying transport long-polls (Telegram) or
 * holds a sync stream (Matrix). It is declared here as the future seam; the
 * Telegram engine currently still drives `transport.getUpdates(...)` directly
 * (see `core/engine.ts`) because wiring `listen()` in today would risk a
 * behaviour change in the long-poll / offset-advance logic. New channels
 * should implement `listen()`; adopting it in the engine is a separate, later
 * step.
 * ============================================================================
