/**
 * Self-load `~/.env` and `~/.config/phantombot/.env` into process.env at
 * startup, with a `reloadEnvFiles()` re-source path used by the harnesses
 * before each agent spawn so `phantombot env set` takes effect mid-session.
 *
 * Why startup load: launchd has no equivalent of systemd's `EnvironmentFile=`
 * plist key, so on macOS phantombot has to source these files itself before
 * any subcommand reads `process.env.X`. On Linux the systemd unit already
 * sources both files, so this is a (cheap) no-op there — the `existing-wins`
 * policy below means anything systemd already set keeps its value.
 *
 * Why reload-on-spawn: `phantombot env set NAME value` writes atomically to
 * disk but does NOT mutate the running phantombot daemon's `process.env`.
 * Without re-sourcing, a freshly-saved secret is invisible to the harnessed
 * agent until the daemon restarts. Each harness calls `reloadEnvFiles()`
 * right before spawning so the agent sees the latest file state.
 *
 * Sticky-vs-reloadable semantics:
 *   - At boot we track which keys were FILLED IN FROM A FILE. Those keys
 *     are reloadable: a later `reloadEnvFiles()` may update or delete them
 *     to match the file.
 *   - Keys that were already in `process.env` at boot (shell-export, systemd
 *     EnvironmentFile=, parent process) are sticky: they were never tracked
 *     as file-sourced, so reload won't touch them. This preserves the
 *     "explicit shell export wins" guarantee for the launching shell.
 *   - A new key that appears in the file post-boot AND isn't already in
 *     the env gets loaded and tracked (so a future reload can also update
 *     it). If a new file-key collides with an existing env key, the env
 *     wins — same shell-wins rule.

 *   - `size` is the belt to the mtime suspenders. Some VFS layers (overlayfs,
