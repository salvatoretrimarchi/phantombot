/**
 * Single-instance lock for `phantombot run`.
 *
 * Prevents two phantombot run processes from racing each other on the
 * same Telegram bot token (would cause sporadic duplicate replies and
 * missed messages — Telegram getUpdates serves whichever long-poll
 * arrives first per update).
 *
 * Lock file lives at $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/phantombot.run.lock if available
 * (tmpfs, cleaned on reboot — ideal), else /tmp/phantombot-<uid>.run.lock.
 *
 * Acquisition: O_EXCL create with our identity inside. On EEXIST, read the
 * existing holder and decide whether it's still alive (reclaim if not).
 *
 * ── PID REUSE — why we record more than a bare PID (item d) ──
 * Liveness used to be a bare `process.kill(pid, 0)`. That has a nasty failure
 * mode: PIDs are recycled. If phantombot crashes holding the lock and the OS
 * later hands that same numeric PID to some UNRELATED process (a cron job, a
 * shell, anything), `kill(pid,0)` succeeds and we conclude "the lock is still
 * held" — forever. phantombot then refuses to start, with no real conflict.
 *
 * Fix: alongside the PID we record a process-INSTANCE token — the kernel boot
 * id plus the process start-time from /proc/<pid>/stat. PID + boot + start-time
 * uniquely identifies one process instance; a recycled PID has a DIFFERENT
 * start-time, so we can tell "the original phantombot is alive" from "a
 * stranger inherited its PID" and reclaim the stale lock in the latter case.
 *
 * The token is best-effort and Linux-specific (/proc). On platforms where we
 * can't read it (macOS dev boxes), we degrade to the old PID-only liveness
 * check — no worse than before, and those aren't the always-on production host.
