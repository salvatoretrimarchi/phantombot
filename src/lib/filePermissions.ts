/**
 * Cross-platform "lock this file down to just me" primitive.
 *
 * On POSIX the caller already writes sensitive files at mode 0o600, and the
 * kernel enforces it — nothing to do here, so this is a no-op. On Windows the
 * POSIX permission bits passed to writeFile are IGNORED: a freshly created file
 * inherits its parent directory's ACL, which on a shared machine can grant read
 * access to other principals (BUILTIN\Users, etc.). For the persona's crown
 * jewel — identity.json, which holds the nsec every vault secret is encrypted
 * under — that is not acceptable, so we apply an explicit restrictive ACL.
 *
 * The Windows lockdown does two things via `icacls`:
 *   /inheritance:r   — remove all INHERITED ACEs (drops whatever the parent dir
 *                      would have granted: Users, Authenticated Users, etc.)
 *   /grant:r <me>:F  — replace any explicit grant for the current user with a
 *                      single Full-control ACE.
 * The net DACL is exactly one ACE: the current user, full control. Everyone
 * else — including standard users on the same box — is denied by absence.
 *
 * Fails CLOSED: if the current account can't be resolved or icacls errors, this
 * THROWS. Callers apply it to a tempfile BEFORE hard-linking it into place, so a
 * throw means no identity.json is ever created — far better than silently
 * persisting the nsec in a file other users could read.
