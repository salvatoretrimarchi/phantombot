/**
 * Capability-routing config for the Pi harness.
 *
 * This is DISTINCT from the primary→fallback harness chain (that's failover —
 * try the next harness when one dies). Capability routing is WITHIN a single
 * Pi turn: a strong-but-narrow PRIMARY model delegates a vision subtask to an
 * IMAGE model via the `look_at_image` tool registered by the bundled Pi
 * extension (see pi-extension/capability-routing/). The CODING model is read
 * here too, but it drives the per-turn coding-brain swap in harnesses/pi.ts —
 * not a delegation tool.
 *
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE ENV-VAR CONTRACT
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The wizard (`phantombot harness`) persists the operator's choices in TWO
 * places, and the Pi extension reads ONLY the env vars at load time:
 *
 *   PHANTOMBOT_PRIMARY_MODEL   — the primary/orchestrator model id (bare name
 *                                as printed by `pi --list-models`, e.g.
 *                                "gpt-5.2" or "~anthropic/claude-opus-latest").
 *                                Empty / unset = "use Pi's configured default"
 *                                (no override; the extension routes nothing).
 *   PHANTOMBOT_IMAGE_MODEL     — the vision delegate. ALWAYS set when routing is
 *                                configured: an explicit pick, or — when the
 *                                primary is itself multimodal and no pick was
 *                                made — the PRIMARY model id. We keep it set even
 *                                for a vision primary so a text-only coding
 *                                delegate (after a coding-brain swap) still has a
 *                                `look_at_image` tool; the tool's description
 *                                tells vision-capable models not to use it.
 *   PHANTOMBOT_CODING_MODEL    — the coding model swapped in for a coding turn
 *                                by the per-turn coding-brain swap (harnesses/pi.ts).
 *
 * The same values are mirrored into config.toml under
 * `[harnesses.pi.routing]` (primary_model / image_model / coding_model) so the
 * choice survives a fresh shell and is visible to `phantombot doctor`. config
 * loading (config.ts) and the env file (~/.env, written via the same path as
 * `phantombot env set`) keep the env vars and TOML in sync; env wins, matching
 * every other setting in phantombot.
 *
 * Why env vars at all (vs. the extension reading config.toml)? The extension
 * runs INSIDE the `pi` subprocess that phantombot spawns. phantombot already
 * exports its environment to that child (see harnesses/pi.ts → withPersonaEnv),
 * so env vars are the zero-coupling channel: the extension needs no knowledge
 * of phantombot's config path or TOML schema.
