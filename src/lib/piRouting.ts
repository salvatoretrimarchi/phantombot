/**
 * Capability-routing config for the Pi harness.
 *
 * This is DISTINCT from the primary→fallback harness chain (that's failover —
 * try the next harness when one dies). Capability routing is WITHIN a single
 * Pi turn: a strong-but-narrow PRIMARY model delegates specialist subtasks to
 * an IMAGE model (vision Q&A) and a CODING model (PR/MR-scoped jobs), via the
 * `look_at_image` and `coder` tools registered by the bundled Pi extension
 * (see pi-extension/capability-routing/).
 *
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE ENV-VAR CONTRACT
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The wizard (`phantombot harness`) persists the operator's choices in TWO
 * places, and the Pi extension reads ONLY the env vars at load time:
 *
 *   PHANTOMBOT_PRIMARY_MODEL   — the primary/orchestrator model id (bare name
 *                                as printed by `pi --list-models`, e.g.
 *                                "gpt-5.2" or "~anthropic/claude-opus-latest").
 *                                Empty / unset = "use Pi's configured default"
 *                                (no override; the extension routes nothing).
 *   PHANTOMBOT_IMAGE_MODEL     — the vision delegate. SET ONLY when the primary
 *                                is NOT multimodal. When the primary already
 *                                accepts image input, this is intentionally
 *                                left UNSET so the extension does not register
 *                                `look_at_image` (the primary looks itself).
 *   PHANTOMBOT_CODING_MODEL    — the coding delegate spawned by `coder`.
 *
 * The same values are mirrored into config.toml under
 * `[harnesses.pi.routing]` (primary_model / image_model / coding_model) so the
 * choice survives a fresh shell and is visible to `phantombot doctor`. config
 * loading (config.ts) and the env file (~/.env, written via the same path as
 * `phantombot env set`) keep the env vars and TOML in sync; env wins, matching
 * every other setting in phantombot.
 *
 * Why env vars at all (vs. the extension reading config.toml)? The extension
 * runs INSIDE the `pi` subprocess that phantombot spawns. phantombot already
 * exports its environment to that child (see harnesses/pi.ts → withPersonaEnv),
 * so env vars are the zero-coupling channel: the extension needs no knowledge
 * of phantombot's config path or TOML schema.
