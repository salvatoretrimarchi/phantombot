/**
 * Process-group spawn + kill helpers.
 *
 * Why this exists: a phantombot harness (claude/gemini/pi) commonly
 * spawns its own subprocesses to execute tool calls — `Bash`, `WebFetch`,
 * `gemini usage`, etc. When phantombot kills the harness on timeout or
 * /stop, `Bun.spawn`'s `proc.kill(SIGTERM)` only signals the direct
 * subprocess. The grandchildren are reparented to PID 1 and keep
 * running.
 *
 * The motivating bug (kw-openclaw, 2026-05-02): a `gemini usage` tool
 * call wedged on a TCP read inside the gemini subprocess. After the
 * 600s wall-clock timeout fired, gemini died — but `gemini usage`
 * survived as an orphan with the open socket, eating fds and
 * confusing later runs.
 *
 * Fix: spawn the binary with Bun's `detached: true` option. This puts
 * the spawned process in its own session and process group BEFORE
 * exec, so `pid == pgid == sid` from the moment Bun.spawn returns.
 * We can then signal the entire descendant tree in one syscall via
 * `process.kill(-pid, sig)` — the kernel routes a negative pid to
 * every member of the matching pgid.
 *
 * Why this option vs a `setsid <cmd>` wrapper: a setsid prefix would
 * also work, but it has a brief race — the setsid() syscall doesn't
 * happen until after Bun.spawn returns and the child actually exec's
 * setsid. If you try to kill the group within ~50ms of spawn (rare
 * in production but real in tests), the new pgroup doesn't exist
 * yet and you get ESRCH. Bun's `detached` does the setsid before
 * exec, so the pgroup is live by the time `proc.pid` is observable
 * in the caller.
 *
 * `detached` is undocumented in Bun's public API as of 1.3.x but
 * works reliably (it maps to posix_spawn's POSIX_SPAWN_SETSID flag).
 * If a future Bun release changes this, the fallback is to wrap the
 * cmd in `setsid` and accept the spawn-time race.

/**
 * Ensure an absolute executable's OWN directory is on the child's PATH.
 *
 * Why this exists (the systemd-vs-Zed harness bug, 2026-07-01): the harness
 * CLIs (`pi`, and any nvm/fnm/volta-installed `claude`/`gemini`/`codex`) are
 * Node scripts whose shebang is `#!/usr/bin/env node`. The kernel honors the
 * shebang by re-invoking `env node`, which needs `node` ON PATH. An
 * nvm-installed `pi` lives at `~/.nvm/versions/node/<v>/bin/pi` with `node`
 * RIGHT NEXT TO IT in the same directory — but that directory is only on PATH
 * inside an interactive/desktop session.
 *
 * phantombot's `harnessSearchPath()` is smart enough to FIND `pi` on the
 * filesystem and spawn it by absolute path, so the spawn itself succeeds. But
 * the child inherits phantombot's PATH, and under systemd that PATH is narrow
 * (no nvm dir) — so the shebang's `env node` fails and the process dies with
 * exit 127. Under Zed / VS Code the extension host inherits the desktop
 * session's PATH (nvm already on it), so `node` is found and it Just Works —
 * which is exactly why the same bot answers from the editor but not Telegram.
 *
 * The fix is transport-agnostic: prepend the executable's own directory to the
 * child PATH so `env node` resolves the interpreter sitting beside the binary,
 * no matter how narrow the parent PATH is. This makes systemd behave like the
 * editor without tampering with the user's shell/systemd config.
 *
 * Only acts when `bin` is ABSOLUTE — a bare command name (`"pi"`) is being
 * resolved via the existing PATH, and `dirname("pi")` is `"."`, which we must
 * never inject. Returns a FRESH object (never mutates the caller's env, which
 * may be the shared `process.env` reference) and is a no-op when the directory
 * is already present.
 *
 * Exported for testing.

 * Ensure phantombot's OWN executable directory is on the child's PATH.
 *
 * Why this exists (the Windows "phantombot: command not found" bug,
 * 2026-07-07): a harness turn spawns tool subprocesses — notably the agent's
 * Bash tool — that call back into the `phantombot` CLI (`phantombot memory
 * search`, `phantombot task add`, `phantombot notify`, ...). Those shells
 * inherit the harness's env/PATH. On Windows the daemon is launched by a
 * Scheduled Task whose environment carries only the *machine* PATH, while the
 * phantombot install dir is registered on the *user* PATH — so the CLI is
 * invisible to the spawned shell and every self-call dies with exit 127 /
 * "phantombot: command not found". (The same class bites any launch context
 * with a narrower PATH than the interactive session the install dir lives in.)
 *
 * The install dir is not on any reliably-inherited PATH, but it IS
 * `dirname(process.execPath)` whenever phantombot runs as its compiled
 * single-file binary. Prepend that dir to the child PATH so the agent's shell
 * can always find the CLI, no matter how the daemon was launched. Same spirit
 * as withCommandDirOnPath (#240), but for phantombot's own binary rather than
 * the harness's.
 *
 * Guarded: only acts when the running executable is the phantombot binary
 * itself (not `bun`/`node` running a source checkout), so a dev run never gets
 * the runtime's dir injected. No-op when the dir is already present. Returns a
 * FRESH object; never mutates the caller's env (may be shared `process.env`).
