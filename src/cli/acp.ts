/**
 * `phantombot acp` — register phantombot as a first-class ACP (Agent Client
 * Protocol) agent inside an ACP-capable editor (Zed, JetBrains IDEs, …).
 *
 *   phantombot acp                 run the ACP stdio server (the editor spawns this)
 *   phantombot acp --persona NAME  …bound to a specific persona
 *   phantombot acp install zed       write the Zed settings.json registration
 *   phantombot acp install jetbrains write the JetBrains ~/.jetbrains/acp.json registration
 *   phantombot acp install vscode    install the first-party VS Code extension (.vsix)
 *
 * The connector sits BESIDE the channel layer: it calls runTurn directly with
 * `trusted: true`. The principal is the local OS user who launched the editor —
 * they already have full filesystem access to everything phantombot owns, so the
 * threat judge is skipped (see connectors/acp/turnBridge.ts).
 *
 * The bare `acp` command is the long-running stdio server: the editor launches it
 * as a subprocess and talks newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdin/stdout.
 * stdout is the protocol channel — NEVER write logs there.
