/**
 * `phantombot tick` — fired every minute by phantombot-tick.timer.
 *
 * Reads tasks where next_run_at <= now() AND active=1, runs each through
 * the harness chain, and either:
 *   - runs the task's normal prompt (the agent owns whether to surface
 *     anything to the user; tick itself is silent), then advances
 *     next_run_at;
 *   - or, if next_review_at <= now(), runs the SELF-REVIEW prompt that
 *     asks the agent KEEP / STOP, and updates the task accordingly.
 *
 * Quiet-by-default contract: tick does NOT post the harness reply to
 * Telegram. The harnessed agent is the sole arbiter of whether the
 * user hears about a fire — if it wants to notify, it calls
 * `phantombot notify` from inside the prompt. This matches the standing
 * rule embedded in the persona builder ("Scheduled tasks run silently
 * by default — no Telegram chatter on every fire") which the previous
 * auto-delivery branch directly contradicted.
 *
 * Lockfile prevents overlapping ticks: if a previous tick is still
 * running (e.g. a slow Claude call), this minute's tick exits 0 and
 * the next minute's tick picks up. Skipping is preferred over piling
 * up — see the "skip missed runs" decision in the design doc.
 *
 * The tick runs as the OS user that owns the systemd timer
 * (typically the same user as `phantombot run`), so it inherits both
 * EnvironmentFile=-%h/.config/phantombot/.env and EnvironmentFile=-%h/.env
 * from the unit. Spawned harnesses see the merged environment.
