/**
 * Single-turn coordinator.
 *
 * Given a user message + a configured persona / harness chain / memory store,
 * runTurn:
 *   1. Loads the persona files from disk.
 *   2. Loads the most recent N turns from memory (skipped if noHistory).
 *   3. Builds the system prompt via persona/builder.
 *   4. Runs the harness chain via orchestrator/fallback, streaming chunks
 *      out to the caller as they arrive.
 *   5. On success — and only on success — persists the user turn followed
 *      by the assistant turn to memory. A failed turn leaves no trace,
 *      so the user can retry without polluting history with half-turns.
 *
 * runTurn is an async generator of HarnessChunk. The caller iterates,
 * surfaces text/progress to wherever (stdout, REPL, future channel
 * adapter), and persistence happens as a side effect when the stream ends.
 *
 * Errors that aren't part of the harness stream (persona missing, memory
 * write failed) propagate as thrown exceptions — the caller is expected
 * to catch them and present cleanly.
