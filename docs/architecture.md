# Architecture

## Goal

Run a chat agent ("Phantom") as a **CLI tool** on the operator's own machine. All model + tool work delegates to a CLI harness (Claude Code primary, [Pi](https://pi.dev) fallback). Phantombot's job is identity + memory + harness fallback.

## What phantombot does

1. **Hosts persona files.** Reads `BOOT.md` / `SOUL.md` / `IDENTITY.md`, optional `MEMORY.md`, optional `tools.md` / `AGENTS.md` from `$XDG_DATA_HOME/phantombot/personas/<name>/`.
2. **Receives one user message** via `phantombot ask "msg"` or via the REPL line loop in `phantombot chat`.
3. **Builds a turn context** for the configured agent: persona + recent memory + retrieved knowledge + the new user message. Retrieval runs over an [Open Knowledge Format](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/how-the-open-knowledge-format-can-improve-data-sharing/) store: **OKF field-weighted BM25 with link-graph expansion** by default, upgrading to **hybrid BM25 + Gemini-embedding vector search** (reciprocal-rank fusion) when an embeddings provider is configured.
4. **Hands the turn to a harness.** Spawns `claude --print --output-format stream-json` (or `pi --print --mode json`) as a subprocess. Persona goes via `--system-prompt`. The user-side payload (history + new message) goes via stdin (claude) or argv (pi).
5. **Streams the harness's stdout** back to the user. Text chunks land on stdout as they arrive; the trailing newline marks end-of-reply.
6. **Falls back** to the next harness in the chain on recoverable error (rate limit, transient network, oversize payload pre-skip).
7. **Persists the turn** (user message + assistant reply) to SQLite for future memory retrieval. **On success only** — failed turns leave no trace, so the user can retry without orphan half-turns in history.

## What phantombot does NOT do

- Translate `tools[]` arrays into anything. Each harness brings its own tools.
- Enforce permission gates on tool calls. The harness handles that — Claude is run with `--permission-mode bypassPermissions`.
- *(Updated since v1.)* Retrieval is now implemented: SQLite FTS5 provides OKF field-weighted BM25 + link-graph expansion as the always-on baseline, with optional Gemini embeddings adding a hybrid vector leg. There is no RAG framework dependency — it's plain FTS5 + a local vector table.
- Run a web UI, dashboard, status page, or admin panel.
- Listen on chat channels (Telegram / Signal / Google Chat). The original skeleton was built for that; the current shape is CLI only. Channels can be added later without rearchitecting.
- Hold API keys. OAuth-on-host: claude / pi are configured separately on the operator's machine and read their own credentials at spawn time.

## Module map

| Module | Responsibility | Talks to |
|---|---|---|
| `src/index.ts` | Entry point. Calls `runMain(mainCommand)`. | `cli/` |
| `src/cli/index.ts` | Citty dispatcher. Wires every subcommand. | `cli/*.ts` |
| `src/cli/{ask,chat,import-persona,list-personas,set-default-persona,history,config,doctor}.ts` | One subcommand each. Each exports a `run*` function for testing. | `orchestrator`, `importer`, `state`, `repl` |
| `src/config.ts` | TOML + XDG + env-var loader. Single source of truth for paths and harness chain. | filesystem, env, `state.ts` |
| `src/state.ts` | Phantombot-managed runtime state (currently just `default_persona`). Lives at `$XDG_DATA_HOME/phantombot/state.json`. | filesystem |
| `src/persona/loader.ts` | Reads BOOT.md / SOUL.md / IDENTITY.md (required) + MEMORY.md / tools.md / AGENTS.md (optional). | filesystem |
| `src/persona/builder.ts` | Concatenates persona pieces + (deferred) retrieved memory + invocation context into a system prompt string. | `loader.ts` |
| `src/memory/store.ts` | bun:sqlite wrapper. `turns` table (`appendTurn`, `recentTurns`, …) + `capture_log` table (`appendCapture`, `lastCaptureAt`, `countCapturesSince`, turn counters for the nudge/doctor). | `bun:sqlite` |
| `src/lib/nightly.ts` | Nightly stage list, per-stage prompt bodies, `.nightly-progress.json` checkpoint read/write, `pendingNightlyStages`. | filesystem |
| `src/cli/doctor.ts` | `phantombot doctor`: reads nightly state/progress + `capture_log`, decides if repair is needed, spawns detached `nightly --resume`. | `memory/store`, `lib/nightly` |
| `src/importer/openclaw.ts` | Walks an OpenClaw agent dir; copies recognized markdown into the personas dir. | filesystem |
| `src/orchestrator/turn.ts` | `runTurn`: persona → memory → harness chain → persist. The one function every entry point calls. | `loader`, `builder`, `memory`, `fallback` |
| `src/orchestrator/fallback.ts` | `runWithFallback`: tries each harness in order, advances on recoverable error, terminates on success or terminal error. Pre-spawn skip when `maxPayloadBytes` is too small. | `harnesses/*` |
| `src/repl/index.ts` | `runChat` (node:readline loop) + `handleSlash` (command dispatch). | `orchestrator/turn`, `memory` |
| `src/harnesses/types.ts` | `Harness`, `HarnessRequest`, `HarnessChunk` (discriminated union). | — |
| `src/harnesses/claude.ts` | `Bun.spawn claude --print --output-format stream-json …`. Stdin payload, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY filtered out. | `claude` CLI |
| `src/harnesses/pi.ts` | `Bun.spawn pi --print --mode json …`. Argv payload (Pi ignores stdin). Declares `maxPayloadBytes`. | `pi` CLI |
| `src/lib/logger.ts` | Structured logs to stdout. | stdout |
| `src/lib/io.ts` | Shared `WriteSink` interface. | — |
| `src/lib/platform.ts` | Cross-platform service-manager router. Picks the backend (systemd/launchd/Task Scheduler) and exposes one `ServiceControl` (`isActive`/`start`/`stop`/`restart`/`rerenderUnitIfStale`), plus hint strings and `logsSpec()` for tailing. | `systemd.ts`, `launchd.ts`, `taskScheduler.ts` |
| `src/lib/{systemd,launchd,taskScheduler}.ts` | Per-OS backends: unit/plist/task templates + a `ServiceControl` impl. Each encapsulates its own keep-alive quirk (systemd `Restart=on-failure`; launchd `KeepAlive`; Windows 1-min `TimeTrigger`), so `stop`/`start` behave consistently across OSes. | `systemctl`/`launchctl`/`schtasks` |
| `src/lib/serviceLifecycle.ts` | `runLifecycleAction` — the shared driver behind `phantombot start/stop/restart`. OS-agnostic: only ever calls `ServiceControl`, never a supervisor directly. | `platform.ts` |
| `src/cli/{start,stop,restart,logs}.ts` | Thin CLI wrappers over `serviceLifecycle`/`logsSpec` for the service-lifecycle verbs. | `lib/serviceLifecycle`, `lib/platform` |
| `src/p2p/` | Relay-free P2P transport (issue #258). The node is a dumb, encrypted-wrap relay: it forwards opaque gift-wraps node-to-node and never decrypts them. Off by default (`config.p2p.enabled`). | `werift`, `nostrCrypto`, `RelayPool`, Bun ws |
| `src/p2p/frame.ts` | Wire-frame contract with the PWA: parse/build `["EVENT", <gift-wrap>]` relay frames, read the recipient off the wrap p-tag. Pure. | — |
| `src/p2p/signaling.ts` | WebRTC handshake (SDP/ICE) over Nostr — NIP-44-encrypted on a dedicated ephemeral kind (21050), separate from the chat 1059 plane. Rides the `RelayPool` seam. | `nostrCrypto`, `RelayPool` |
| `src/p2p/peerConnection.ts` | One werift `RTCPeerConnection` + data channel per peer. Readiness is gated on the **data channel** `open` event, not transport `connected` (the channel opens later; flushing early drops the first frame). | `werift` |
| `src/p2p/localBridge.ts` | `ws://localhost:47100` server (Bun native, loopback-only) for the same-machine PWA. Frames in → route; peer frames → broadcast to PWA. | Bun ws |
| `src/p2p/node.ts` | Orchestrator. Routes frames by recipient pubkey, dials peers on demand, deterministic initiator (smaller pubkey) + `hello` nudge to avoid offer glare, per-peer outbox buffered until the channel opens. All seams injected for testing. | `peerConnection`, `signaling`, `localBridge` |
| `src/p2p/capability.ts` | Capability advertisement (NIP-78 kind 30078) so a peer's PWA can light up its transport ladder. The PWA-side ingestion is a companion phantomchat change. | `RelayPool` |
| `src/p2p/index.ts` | Daemon glue: `buildP2PNode` (from a persona's identity/relays/pool) + `runP2PNode` (start, wait for abort, stop), pushed onto `run`'s task list. | all of `src/p2p/*` |
| `src/cli/p2p.ts` | `phantombot p2p status` — read-only view of the config + a loopback probe. | `config` |

## End-to-end flow

```
phantombot ask "what's on my calendar?"
  → ask.ts: load config, resolve persona, open memory, build harness chain
  → orchestrator.turn.runTurn({ noHistory: true, conversation: "cli:ask", ... })
       → loadPersona(agentDir) → { boot, memory, tools, identitySource, ... }
       → memory.recentTurns(persona, "cli:ask", 20) → [] (skipped: noHistory)
       → buildSystemPrompt(persona, channelCtx) → systemPrompt
       → orchestrator.fallback.runWithFallback([claude, pi], req)
            → estimatePayloadBytes(req) → bytes
            → if bytes > pi.maxPayloadBytes && pi is in chain → log "skipping pi"
            → claude.invoke(req)
                 → Bun.spawn(["claude", "--print", "--output-format", "stream-json", ...,
                              "--system-prompt", systemPrompt],
                              { stdin: "pipe", env: filtered (no ANTHROPIC_API_KEY) })
                 → write history + new message to proc.stdin, close it
                 → for await chunk of proc.stdout: parse stream-json,
                       yield {type:"text"|"progress"|"done"|"error"}
                 → on timeout: state="timed_out", kill SIGTERM, yield error/recoverable
                 → on exit 0: yield {type:"done", finalText, meta:{harnessId,model}}
                 → on exit !=0: yield error/recoverable: code !== 127
            → if recoverable error and chain has more: try pi.invoke(req)
       → on done chunk: skip persistence (noHistory). With --history, append both turns.
  → ask.ts: write the harness's final assistant text to stdout, ensure trailing "\n"
  → exit 0 / 1 / 2
```

### Progress narration in the chat channels

`progress` chunks (and the model text streamed *before* a tool call) become
interim "progress bubbles" — the running "checking your calendar…" commentary.
This is emitted by a per-channel streaming state machine, and that machine is
**duplicated**: `src/channels/core/engine.ts` (Telegram) and
`src/channels/phantomchat/server.ts` (PhantomChat) each carry their own
`flushNarration`. Whether those bubbles appear is gated **per conversation** by
`/chattiness` (`src/lib/chattiness.ts`): a per-conversation override wins, else
the `chattiness` config default decides. The gate lives in **both**
`flushNarration`s — the final reply and error paths are never gated. Scope is
Telegram + PhantomChat only; the editor (ACP) surface is deliberately left
untouched. Any change here touches both channel files (see the `TODO(dedup)`
breadcrumbs) — a future refactor should centralize the loop.

## Memory subsystem

Memory is two layers — see the README `## Memory` section for the operator-facing
picture. From an architecture standpoint:

- **SQLite (`memory.sqlite`)** is machine state. `turns` is a *rolling* per-conversation
  context buffer, deliberately pruned — it is not a transcript archive, and nothing
  should be designed assuming old turns survive. `capture_log` is append-only and
  exists purely as an observability trail.
- **Markdown (the persona dir)** is the durable memory: `memory/<date>.md` daily
  journals → four structured drawers → `kb/` atomic notes → `MEMORY.md`.

Three properties worth knowing when touching this code:

1. **Capture has a CLI** (`phantombot memory capture`). It is the *only* sanctioned
   write path into the daily journal, so every capture leaves a `capture_log` row.
   A CLI cannot *force* a harness to capture — it makes a missed capture observable
   instead of silent.
2. **The 30-turn nudge is mechanical.** `src/channels/telegram.ts` counts user turns
   since the last `capture_log` row; at every multiple of `CAPTURE_NUDGE_INTERVAL`
   (30) it stacks a fixed reminder onto the next system prompt. No LLM decides this.
3. **The nightly is checkpointed and resumable.** It is decomposed into five
   idempotent stages (`essence` → `promote` → `kb` → `compress` → `state`), each a
   bounded harness turn. `.nightly-progress.json` is written after every stage;
   `--resume` skips completed stages. A stage timeout costs one stage, not the night.
   `phantombot doctor` (also wired into the `run` startup catch-up) detects a
   missed/failed/partial nightly and repairs it by spawning a detached `nightly --resume`.

## Open design questions

1. **Streaming display in the REPL.** Text chunks are written to stdout as they arrive. Looks responsive, but if the harness reformats the final reply (claude sometimes does), the user sees draft text replaced by the canonical version when `done` arrives — currently we just persist the canonical version, which may differ from what was on screen. Acceptable trade-off for v1.

2. **History scope.** `phantombot ask` is stateless by default (conversation `cli:ask`, `noHistory: true`) — fitted to non-interactive callers like the Twilio voice-agent that don't want their tool-calls polluting the persona's rolling memory. Pass `--history --conversation <id>` to thread asks together. The Telegram channel uses distinct keys per chat (`telegram:<chat_id>`).

3. **Multi-line REPL input.** Currently line-by-line via node:readline. Long pasted content works (terminal sends it as one line); explicit multi-line mode (Esc-Enter) is not implemented. Add if it bites.

4. **Conversation history import from OpenClaw.** Skipped in v1 because OpenClaw's transcript format isn't formally documented. Add `phantombot import-history <path>` once we have the schema.

5. **Per-persona harness chains.** Today the chain is global. If different personas should use different defaults (Robbie via claude, alt-persona via pi-only), add `[personas.<name>]` overrides in config.toml.

## Non-goals

- Multi-tenant. Phantombot is single-operator.
- Web UI / dashboard. Use the chat itself.
- High availability. One process per host. If it dies, you re-run it.
- Plugins. The codebase is small enough that "fork it and edit" is the supported customization story.
- Tool-call passthrough. The architectural premise is that the harness owns its tools. See the warning at the bottom of `src/harnesses/claude.ts`.
